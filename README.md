WordPress plugin that removes the "Your Browser Is Out of Date" warning in the administration dashboard.

## Description

WordPress 3.2 introduced a new dashboard widget that warns you if you're not using the latest version of your chosen browser. While some may find this useful, if your clients/contributors/other interested parties cannot upgrade their browser for whatever reason (or simply choose not to), you can disable this warning across the board rather than scare them with warning messages they have no power to control.

## Installation

1. Place the tc-disable-browser-upgrade-warning directory inside your plugins directory.
2. Navigate to the Plugins section of the Dashboard and click "Activate".

## Changelog

### Version 2.0.0
* Code rewrite to WordPress best practices.

### Version 1.0.1
* Normalized inconsistent usage of "Update" vs. "Upgrade" in plugin name.

### Version 1.0
* Initial release.
